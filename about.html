    <h1>Our history</h1>

    <article>
      Over the years there has been a food supply deficit,either from problems
      of infrastructure or transport.Some many even argue that lack of
      reputation amongst business owners largely contributes this negligence as
      well. There instances where buyers pays for goods in trust but ends up
      being swindled by there sellers.Over all,there is a great deal of mistrust
      among people in business. Ada miltiple ventures over the years has built
      strongly on foundation of integrity and strong morals and ethics amongst
      it workers. This has boosted our business opportunities from people from
      the length and breadth of the country, who are either buying and paying
      trust or supplying the commodities in trust. We started small from selling
      perishable goods on the road of the market.We did not even have shop of
      our own.We rode the storm of the harshest weather and some of the most
      malign treatment one can ever experience,to the point where we were able
      to rent a shop but did not have enough goods to fill. We went from gaining
      the trust of a few distributors to actually affording a chunk of our
      goods. It is been a rollercoaster journey; We encounter series of
      armedrobberies and property destruction by government agencies who only
      wanted bribe, at some point we started afresh but the good thing is we
      lost the money but not experience. We could pick ourselves back up as fast
      as possible because of the existing business relationships gathered. To
      Ada multiple ventures spans across the nation as a renowned business
      thanks to God and an unwavering resilience. We have grown from petty
      trading to retailing and to wholesale distributors. Our business outlets
      cuts across the country to give consumers the best competitive price and a
      value for their money. When we were well ready, we thought it well to
      establish our business online, ofcourse this is not an easy task as it
      involves a great deal of planning and resources, so that we can give
      customers a seemless shopping experience. We implore you to throw your
      shopping feedbacks and criticism as that is only how we are going to
      improve and serve you better,by knowing how you feel.
      <h2>Giving back</h2>
      We are not only about business, we also give back to the society that made
      us who we are today by giving you. We run promotions from time to
      time,please seize the opportunities. We are intent on making sure the less
      opportuned in our society gets quality primary and secondry education
      through our fully funded scholarship programmes. We priotize women in our
      society and have loan schemes ranging from #100,000-500,000 to business
      women. We also have vocational programs for widows to learn skills for
      free to set them up as independent women in our society. Plans are in
      place to see we expand our philantropy to neighbouring countries like
      Niger,Ghana and Cameroun, as our business is fast growing into a
      WestAfrican business.
